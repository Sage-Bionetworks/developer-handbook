We create and maintain coding conventions to ensure successful collaboration. We want to work together on these conventions in a deliberate way, repeatedly discussing, writing, and reviewing this evolving document.

For coders, the code is part of how we live - itâ€™s similar to how you organize your residence. To some people, it really matters that forks face handle-up in the dishwasher, or that the toilet paper hangs over the roll. These are the conventions and the optional but recommended preferences. But, other things are best practices -- you really should change those batteries in your fire alarm once per year. Then there are the required, like having to pay utilities.

Coding conventions add predictability, uniformity, and proven standards to the way we write code, which allows us to work more efficiently. This handbook documents these conventions and suggests practical tips.
