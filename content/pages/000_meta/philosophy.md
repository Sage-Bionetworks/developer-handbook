We need coding conventions, because we are plural, because we work together and we want to do this in a deliberate way. We want to think about how to work well together. We want to discuss it and write it down and then discuss it again. This is an evolving document.

For coders, the code is part of how we live. It's like how you keep your house. Do you know how to live with people? To some people, it really matters where you put the milk in the refrigerator, or whether the utensils are put in the dishwasher pointy-side up or down. These are the conventions and the preferences. But, other things are best practices -- you really should change those batteries in your fire alarm once per year. Still others are requirements: Sage would like for you to add a code of conduct to each new repository.

So, we need coding conventions to get our work done smoothly in an optimally social way.

This is a handbook of both these conventions as well as practical tips on how to get things done.
