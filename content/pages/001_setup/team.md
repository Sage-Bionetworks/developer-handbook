Summary: Suggestions on how to set up Github teams.
Status: published

The easiest way to manage people’s access to the code in your repository is to set up a Github team. Teams SHOULD own repositories rather than individuals to make the continuous management of the repository go smoothly. To add a team, from your Github organization (for example, [Sage-Bionetworks](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks)), click on the “Teams” tab and you will see a “New Team” button.

Who should be in a team? The following are common bases for creating teams, and which one suits you depends on your situation:
* The people on an organizational team
* The collaborators on a particular project
* People across the organization who have expertise in a certain area 

After creating the team, or choosing an existing one, you can grant it access by [adding the team](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/managing-teams-and-people-with-access-to-your-repository) in the repository settings. You can add teams or people under Settings > Collaborators and Teams. It’s RECOMMENDED to have at least one team that serves as the administrators of the repository; optionally you can add other contributors with more restricted levels of access.
