CICD stands for Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment. It is the set of practices that aim to bridge the gap between development and operation activities. These practices are aided by tools that assist with building, testing, containerization, and measuring certain code metrics. Although these tools are important, CICD practices are dependent on developer mindset and the alignment between engineering teams, IT teams, and operation teams.
